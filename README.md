# 🚗 Smart Vehicle Violation Detection System  
*(Helmet & Seatbelt Detection using YOLOv8)*  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project detects **helmet** and **seatbelt** violations using a **YOLOv8** object detection model and simple rule logic.  
It can process real-time video streams or recorded footage, highlight violations, save snapshots, and log all detections for reporting.

> 🚫 *Traffic light violation detection was excluded as per the final project scope.*

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect **helmet** and **seatbelt** usage in video frames.  
- Identify and log **violations** (missing helmet or seatbelt).  
- Save snapshots for each violation.  
- Provide a simple GUI to view logs and evidence.  
- Support **real-time detection** or **offline video analysis**.
